# Analog-Clock

An analog clock is a tool for reading the time of day. The shortest hand indicates the hour, a longer hand indicates the minutes, and the longest arm indicates the seconds. Some analog clocks have only two hands: the shorter hand indicating the hour and the longer hand indicating the minutes. The other hand we have is second hand which is longer than minute hand and indicates the second.
